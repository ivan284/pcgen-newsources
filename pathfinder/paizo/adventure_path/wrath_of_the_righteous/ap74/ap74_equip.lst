The armor requires 24 hours to attune itself to the wearer and her patron deity, after which point the images on the armor shift to match the symbol of the wearer's patron deity (or remain associated with Iomedae if the wearer doesn't worship a deity). Thereafter, once per day the armor's wearer can offer a prayer to her deity (or Iomedae) as a swift action to increase the armor's enhancement bonus to +2 for 10 rounds. For this duration, the armor also grants a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws. A paladin wearing armor of the pious can use her lay on hands ability one additional time per day; a mythic paladin wearing armor of the pious also gains one additional use of mythic power per day. An evil character who wears armor of the pious gains 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the armor is worn and disappear when the armor is removed-they never become permanent but can't be overcome in any way as long as the armor is worn.

Anyone who drinks this substance must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of cold damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Thereafter, the target gains 1d10+5 temporary hit points, cold resistance 5, and darkvision 60 feet.

Each time a creature takes a dose of shadowb/ood, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become addicted - shadowblood addiction is a severe addiction (see page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). A creature under the influence of shadawblood or suffering from shadowblood addiction takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws against possession type effects made by demons, and can never gain the benefits of protection from evil or similar spells against such effects.
